# Docker Compose Lab

  - I decided to use docker desktop for this lab because I am a masochist
  - I chose to install wordpress for my docker adventure
  - I followed this guide: https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/run-docker-wordpress
  - From the guide, I followed a link to install a wordpress image with the following command: docker run --name some-wordpress --network some-network -d wordpress
  - I created a wordpress directory and created a .yml file inside with the appropriate contents

  - I then ran the following command to create and run the containers: docker compose up -d
  - I then pasted this into my search engine to open wordpress: http://localhost:8000/
  - From here I created my site named "fiberopticfriday", with my username: alechoward4. I then logged in
